# Stock Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical data and applying a **Linear Regression** model. By leveraging stock market trends and historical price movements, the model aims to forecast future stock prices with the help of supervised learning.

## Project Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging problem due to the high volatility and numerous factors influencing market prices. In this project, we use **Linear Regression**, a simple yet effective machine learning technique, to model the relationship between past stock prices and predict future values.

### Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, normalization, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of stock price trends over time, including moving averages and volatility.
- Model Implementation: Using **Linear Regression** to fit historical data and make predictions.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**.
