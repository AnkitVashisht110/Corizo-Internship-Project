# Stock Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using historical data and applying a **Linear Regression** model. By leveraging stock market trends and historical price movements, the model aims to forecast future stock prices with the help of supervised learning.

## Project Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging problem due to the high volatility and numerous factors influencing market prices. In this project, we use **Linear Regression**, a simple yet effective machine learning technique, to model the relationship between past stock prices and predict future values.

### Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, normalization, and feature engineering.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization of stock price trends over time, including moving averages and volatility.
- Model Implementation: Using **Linear Regression** to fit historical data and make predictions.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R-squared**.

# Wine Classification using Random Forest

## Project Overview

Wine quality prediction is an important problem in the wine industry, as the quality of a wine is a subjective measure but can be influenced by its chemical properties. In this project, we use Random Forest, a powerful ensemble learning technique, to model the relationship between the physicochemical properties of wine and classify the wine into different quality ratings.

### Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing the data, and feature selection to improve model accuracy.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the distribution of wine quality scores and understanding the correlation between the input features and the quality rating. This includes generating heatmaps and exploring key features that contribute most to wine quality.
- Model Implementation: Using the Random Forest Classifier to fit the historical wine data and classify the wine quality based on its chemical properties.
- Model Tuning: Applying GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters like the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum samples split, to enhance the model's performance.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and the F1-Score. Also, analyzing the confusion matrix to understand misclassifications.
